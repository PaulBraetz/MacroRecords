# MacroRecords

"Primitive obsession is the tendency to represent domain concepts as language primitives."

**Escape primitive obsession by introducing bespoke value object types for these concepts.**

This source generator will generate simple structs that wrap a single type.
The advantages to this approach include:
- type safety when operating on domain concepts
- value integrity checks upon instance creation and casting
- use of the ubiquitous language for programmatic domain representations

To get started, take a look at the `TestApp` project. It includes a sample value object named `Age`.
